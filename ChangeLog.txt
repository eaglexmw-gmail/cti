Eliminate several nanosleep calls, by checking instance state and
setting GetData() wait flag accordingly.

V4L2Capture.c: Better BGR3 handling.

Make Wav_buffer.data be a void pointer, require casting to operate on data,
since data isn't always 16-bit.

Initial working DV support.


2012-Sep-05 16:04:23

Minor cleanups in new Callback API.
Add command-line key=value API, set up in cti_app.c, initially used in ScriptV00.c.
Start filling in LibDV support.

Cleaned things up a bit, the main application loop waits for
a UI callback function using new Callback_*() API.  SDL fills 
it in.  This might actually work on OSX now.

This snapshot builds, but the ui_loop business is actually broken, I
just wanted to capture it before I fix it.
